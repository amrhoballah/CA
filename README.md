Running Instructions:
Store the program to be run in the "resources" folder in the project directory.
From the terminal navigate to the project directory then run "java src/Main.java {Program file name} >> output.txt"
The termin output will be available in a text file inside the project directory as the required printouts are greater than what can be shown inside the terminal.
